# hello-webcomponent-import
A simple example of Hello World written with Web Components utilizing [HTML imports](http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/imports/).

## Do this first
  Before looking at the HTML imports take a look at how to achieve this in [Plain HTML and JavaScript](https://github.com/DevelopIntelligenceBoulder/hello-plain-old-javascript) and how to achieve this with the [HTML5 Web Component template element](https://github.com/DevelopIntelligenceBoulder/hello-webcomponent-template).
  
## Browser Support
  Check out [Can I Use](http://caniuse.com/#feat=imports) to see if/when [IE](https://status.modern.ie/htmlimports), [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/HTML_Imports) and Safari will adopt the use of Web Component HTML imports. Web components are fully supported in Chrome and Opera.
  
## What is this?
  This example shows how to utilize HTML imports from the Web Component Specification. The HTML imports allow for separating HTML templates into separate files.
  
### Within the js/main.js
The application namespace is created. It is a simple JavaScript namespace that the application architecture is attached too.

### Within the js/hello-component.js
A JavaScript module is created to handle component logic. The component exposes a render function that is invoked to merge the model properties into the DOM template. 

### Within the js/application-controller.js
An initialization function is utilized to start the view interaction. This method is invoked when the DOM is ready to be interacted with. The controller hands the component the model that is to be applied.

### Within the index.html
The index.html contains the application element, just a plain old HTML element. In this case a `<div id="app">`. It also contains a `<link>` to the external HTML template that is to be imported.

## Instructions
1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Run `npm start` to get the application running on the web server
    * Packages needed for this application will be installed (i.e. jQuery & Express)
    * The Node/Express Web Server will start
3. Go to `http://localhost:8080/src/` in your web browser
